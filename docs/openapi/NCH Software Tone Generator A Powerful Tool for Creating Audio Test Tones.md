One of the applications of NCH Software - Tone Generator is to create test tones for radio audio level alignment. This can help to ensure that the sound quality and volume are consistent across different channels and devices. Another application is to create harmonics by generating multiple sound frequencies that are related by a simple ratio. Harmonics are important for musical instruments and voice production. A third application is to create sweeps or noise waveforms that can be used for testing the frequency response and distortion of speakers, headphones, microphones, or other audio equipment.
 
NCH Software - Tone Generator is compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and iOS devices. It has a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to easily adjust the tone settings and preview the results. The program also supports log or linear sweep tone generation, mono or stereo operation, and constant or varying tone levels. Users can download a free trial version of NCH Software - Tone Generator from the official website[^1^] or purchase the full version online[^2^]. The program is also available as an iOS app from the App Store[^3^].
 
If you are looking for a powerful and versatile tool for creating audio test tones, NCH Software - Tone Generator might be the right choice for you.
