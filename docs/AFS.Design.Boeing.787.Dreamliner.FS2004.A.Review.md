## Features
 
The AFS Design Boeing 787 Dreamliner FS2004 comes with several models and liveries, including the 787-8 and 787-9 variants, and the house, Qatar Air, Etihad Airways, Qantas Airways, Air Canada, United Airlines, and Japan Airlines paint schemes. The external model is very detailed, with animations for flaps, slats, spoilers, gear, doors, hatches, thrust reversers, and winglets. The lighting effects are also impressive, with beacon, strobe, nav, landing, taxi, logo, and cabin lights.
 
The virtual cockpit is equally impressive, with a fully functional panel that includes five multi-function displays (MFDs), a center console with a flight management computer (FMC), a radio display with transponders, trim and engine thrust lever control, a yoke with controllable switches, an upper panel with about 100 switches, a seatbelt and no smoking sign with sound effects, an autopilot system with various modes (ILS, FD, ALT, VS, HDG, NAV, speed, Mach, Loc, autothrottle/master), a head-up display (HUD) that shows artificial horizon, velocity, G-force, Mach number, TAS, IAS, compass, QNH (barometric pressure), altitude and pitch angle. The FMC has 15 different menus that allow you to use a flight plan, calculate courses based on wind and altitude data, follow waypoints and course guidance. The cockpit also has panel light and window reflections effects.
 
## Performance
 
The AFS Design Boeing 787 Dreamliner FS2004 has realistic flight dynamics that simulate the characteristics of the real aircraft. The aircraft is easy to fly and handle thanks to the fly-by-wire system that controls the flight surfaces electronically. The aircraft also has a smooth nose contour and noise-reducing chevrons on the engines that reduce drag and noise. The aircraft is designed to be fuel-efficient and can fly long distances with less fuel consumption than other airliners. The aircraft can cruise at Mach 0.85 (567 mph) at an altitude of 43,000 feet.
 
## Quality
 
The AFS Design Boeing 787 Dreamliner FS2004 has high-quality textures that give the aircraft a realistic look. The textures have specular shine effects that reflect light depending on the angle of view. The textures also have night lighting and alpha technology effects that create shadows and transparency effects. The textures have a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels for the cockpit and 1024x1024 pixels for the external model.
 
## Conclusion
 
The AFS Design Boeing 787 Dreamliner FS2004 is a great add-on for FS2004 users who want to experience flying one of the most modern and efficient airliners in the world. The add-on has a detailed and realistic model that includes animations, lighting effects, a fully functional cockpit with an FMC and a HUD system. The add-on also has realistic flight dynamics that simulate the performance of the real aircraft. The add-on is available for $25 from various online stores[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^].
