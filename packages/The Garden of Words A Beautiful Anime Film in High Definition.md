The film features an original soundtrack composed by Daisuke Kashiwa, who also worked with Shinkai on his previous film Children Who Chase Lost Voices. The soundtrack consists of 12 tracks that blend piano, strings, guitar, and electronic elements to create a soothing and atmospheric mood. The main theme of the film is "Rain", a song performed by Motohiro Hata, a popular Japanese singer-songwriter. The song expresses the feelings of the main characters and their longing for each other.
 
The film also explores some themes that are relevant to modern society, such as the pressure of education and work, the gap between generations, and the meaning of love and happiness. The film shows how Takao and Yukari struggle with their own problems and expectations, and how they find solace and inspiration in each other. The film also raises some questions about the morality and consequences of their relationship, as they are separated by age and social status.
